Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. <\/li><li>It's possible to work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/integrations\/\">integrations<\/a> to speed up your workflows, connect email lists, build communities and much more.<\/li><\/ol><h2 id=\"behind-the-scenes\">Behind the scenes<\/h2><p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/pricing\">Ghost(Pro)<\/a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.<\/p><p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/TryGhost\">community<\/a>.<\/p><h2 id=\"next-up-the-editor\">Next up, the editor<\/h2><p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:2369\/the-editor\/\">the Ghost editor<\/a>.

While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.<\/p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not<\/em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.<\/p><h2 id=\"invite-your-team\">Invite your team <\/h2><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:<\/p><p><strong>Contributors<\/strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted<\/strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.<\/p><p><strong>Authors<\/strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit \u00a0and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted<\/strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.<\/p><p><strong>Editors<\/strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.<\/p><p><strong>Administrators<\/strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner<\/strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/pricing\/\"><strong>Ghost(Pro)<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p><blockquote><em>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.<\/em><\/blockquote><h2 id=\"next-organising-content\">Next: Organising content<\/h2><p>Find out how to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:2369\/organising-content\/\">organise your content<\/a> with sensible tags and authors, or for more advanced configurations, how to create custom content structures using dynamic routing.<\/p>",

            "html": "<h2 id=\"sensible-tagging\">Sensible tagging<\/h2><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.<\/p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. <\/p><p>For example you may tag some content with News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>\/tag\/news\/<\/code> and <code>\/tag\/podcast\/<\/code>, respectively.<\/p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News<\/code> <em>and<\/em> <code>Podcast<\/code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.<\/p><h3 id=\"the-primary-tag\">The primary tag<\/h3><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. <\/p><blockquote><em><strong>News<\/strong>, Technology, Startup<\/em><\/blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.<\/p><h3 id=\"private-tags\">Private tags<\/h3><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.<\/p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.<\/p><blockquote><em><strong>News<\/strong>, #video<\/em><\/blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. <\/p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/docs\/api\/handlebars-themes\/\">theme docs<\/a>.<\/em><\/blockquote><h2 id=\"dynamic-routing\">Dynamic routing<\/h2><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. <\/p><p>You may not want content tagged with <code>News<\/code> to exist on: <code>example.com\/tag\/news<\/code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com\/news<\/code> .<\/p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.<\/p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: <\/p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template<\/li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content<\/li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors<\/li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts<\/li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com\/europe\/story-title\/<\/code><br><\/li><\/ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href=\"http:\/\/yaml.org\/spec\/1.2\/spec.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">YAML<\/a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/docs\/api\/handlebars-themes\/routing\/\">documentation<\/a> for further details.<\/em><\/blockquote><h2 id=\"next-apps-integrations\">Next: Apps &amp; Integrations<\/h2><p>Work with all your favourite apps and tools using our <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:2369\/apps-integrations\/\">integrations<\/a>, or create your own custom integrations with webhooks.<\/p>",
